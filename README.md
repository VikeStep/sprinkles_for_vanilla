sprinkles_for_vanilla
=====================

This is a mod that adds a config for vanilla. An example config is shown in [sprinkles_for_vanilla.cfg](https://github.com/VikeStep/sprinkles_for_vanilla/blob/master/sprinkles_for_vanilla.cfg).

If you have any feature requests please make an issue on the github with the tag 'enhancement' and I will look into it. If you don't have a github account you can PM me on reddit/FTB Forums/curseforge/MC Forums.

This mod also uses ASMHelper by squeek to help me tweak some of these classes. Since this mod uses class transformers it may causes issues with other mods but I have not ran into any major compatibility issues.
